2. Deploy to a static host (e.g., Vercel). Ensure `vercel.json` is honored for security headers.

## SEO & Content Notes
- Primary keyword targets: `fear me game`, `Jeff the Killer dating sim`, `fear me walkthrough`, `fear me endings`, `fear me faq`.
- Headings follow a strict hierarchy: single `<h1>` in the game tab, with supporting `<h2>`/`<h3>`/`<h4>` for subsections.
- JSON-LD schema describes the game, platforms (Web/Windows/Android), and upcoming roadmap elements.
- FAQ responses align with E-E-A-T guidelines by citing official itch.io touchpoints and safety warnings.
